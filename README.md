## Description

This project is a .NET 6 Blazor Web Application developed following the N-Tier architecture principles. It's based on the foundational concepts presented in Patrick God's YouTube tutorial ([Watch Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_P-qJj_8Bg)). Building upon those basics, the application has been enhanced with Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), the Service-Repository pattern, and the use of AutoMapper for object mapping, resulting in a more structured, maintainable, and scalable application.

## Features

- **N-Tier Architecture:** Separation of concerns is achieved by organizing the application into multiple layers, enhancing the maintainability and scalability.
- **Entity Framework:** Utilizes Entity Framework for data access, providing a powerful and developer-friendly way to interact with databases.
- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):** Implementation of DTOs to safely transfer data across processes and reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network.
- **Service-Repository Pattern:** This design pattern separates the logic that retrieves the data and maps it to the entity model from the business logic that acts on the model.
- **AutoMapper:** Automates the mapping between DTOs and entity models, simplifying the codebase and reducing manual mapping errors.
